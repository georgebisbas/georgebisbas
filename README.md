### Hi there 👋

This is George Bisbas (aka Georgios Bismpas/Γεώργιος Μπίσμπας)

My CV is available [here](docs/cv_bisbas_04jul25.pdf).

Short Bio:

- PostDoc @Imperial College London, May 2022 - Mar 2025
- PhD @Department of Computing, Imperial College London, 2023
- MSc in Advanced Computer and Communication Systems, specialization in Intelligent Systems - Methods of Computational Intelligence and Applications, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2019
- Dipl. Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2017

I like working at the intersection of high-performance computing, domain-specific languages, compiler optimizations, and code generation for computational science applications.

- 🔭 I am mostly allocating my time to two open-source projects:
  - https://github.com/devitocodes/devito
  - https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl
