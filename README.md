### Hi there 👋

This is George Bisbas (aka Georgios Bismpas/Γεώργιος Μπίσμπας)

I am working as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at Imperial College London.
I like working at the intersection of high-performance computing, domain-specific languages, and compiler optimizations for computational science.

- 🔭 I am mostly allocating my time to two open-source projects:
  - https://github.com/devitocodes/devito
  - https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl


Short Bio:

- PhD from the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, 2023
- MSc in Advanced Computer and Communication Systems, specialization in Intelligent Systems - Methods of Computational Intelligence and Applications, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2019
- Dipl. Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2017
